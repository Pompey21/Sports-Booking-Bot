# Automate booking those damn classes!

I have recently been very frustated by not being able to book Lane Swimming slots, so i made this quick and dirty playwright script to do it for me everyday.

This has been deployed as a scheduled task on heroku as described [here](https://saqibameen.com/deploy-python-cron-job-scripts-on-heroku/).

Feel free to have fun with it.
